V1 -Comparing Bubble, Selection, and Insertion Sort-:
  The Three Sorting Algorithms Names:
    Elementary Sorting Algorithm.
    Quadratic Sorting Algorithm.
      In the worst case the time complexity of all of them is O(n²).
  Elementary Sorting Algorithm And Space Complexity:
    All of them considered as O(1).
      Some of other faster algorithms create a bunch of smaller arrays. for example: 
        Merge sort.
          Its space complexity is O(n) and not constant.
  Elementary Sorting Algorithm With Nearly Sorted Data:
    Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort:
      We will need to fewer processes to produce the sorted array.
      So we can say there are O(n) in this case.
    Selection Sort:
      It will do the same work always, it's always O(n²).
  Insertion Sort Advantage:
    Good as an online algorithm.
    If you need your data to be continuously sorted, while adding new values with the time.
      Because for each new value we will need to single iteration, no more. 
  Elementary Sorting Algorithm Advantages:
    Easy to understand.
    Good start to understand the more complex algorithms more smoothly.
    Can perform better on very small datasets.

V1 -Intro to Dynamic Programming-:
  Objectives:
    Define what dynamic programming is.
    Explain what overlapping subProblems are.
    Understand what optimal substructure is.
    Solve more challenging problems using dynamic programming.
  What is Dynamic Programming:
    A method for solving a complex problem by: 
      Breaking it down into a collection of simpler subProblems. 
      Solving each of those subProblems just once, and storing their solutions.
    Most problems cannot be solved with it.
    If we can solve a problem by DP, it can make a huge difference in their performance.
      Like divide and conquer.
  Why it's called dynamic programming:
    It used before to describe something that had nothing to do with computers.
    Dynamic:
      Capture the time-varying aspect of the problems, and because it sounded impressive.
    Programming:
      Referred to the use of the method to find an optimal program. 
        In the sense of a military schedule for training or logistics.
    Refers to is coming up with an optimal solution, both: 
      Outside of the code world, in math in general, and planning or making decisions.
      Into the world of code and programming as we know it.
V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-:
  When we can use DP:
    If only we have Optimal SubStructure And Overlapping SubProblems.
  What is Overlapping SubProblems:
    A problem is said to have overlapping SubProblems if: 
      The problem can be broken down into SubProblems which are reused several times.
    We can break one problem down into smaller pieces, and some of those pieces are reused.
      They are not unique.
    Example Fibonacci sequence:
      fibonacci-sequence:
        ../Assets/V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-/fibonacci-sequence.png
      If we're trying to find the fifth number and the Fibonacci sequence:
        ../Assets/V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-/fibonacci-sequence-diagram.png
  Example of problem include SubProblems that doesn't overlap:
    Merge sort regular cases:
      ../Assets/V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-/merge-sort-regular-cases.png
        We're taking a bigger problem and breaking it into smaller pieces. SubProblems.
          But there is no overlap, We're not repeating the same thing.
          There's no way we can reduce our duplication.
      This case often lends itself to the divide and conquer pattern.
  Special Case -Overlapping SubProblems with merge sort-:
    ../Assets/V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-/merge-sort-very-special-case.png
V3 -Optimal Substructure-:
  What is Optimal Substructure
    A problem is said to have optimal substructure if: 
      An optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
    Property of a problem. 
      Indicates a solution can be constructed optimally from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
  Examples have the Optimal Substructure Property:
    Fibonacci Sequence:
      The optimal solution for Fibonacci of five depends on: 
        The best solution for Fibonacci of four and three.
          See:
            ../Assets/V2 -Overlapping Subproblems-/fibonacci-sequence-diagram.png
    Shortest path between vertices on a graph:
      ../Assets/V3 -Optimal Substructure-/find-shortest-path.png
        The shortest path from A to D, knowing that the complete route is A -> B -> C -> D, is:
          the shortest paths from:
            A to B With B to C With C to D, so now:
              We have couple of subproblems.
              The optimal solution is constructed from optimal solutions of these subproblems.
  Examples do not have the Optimal Substructure Property:
    Find the longest path:
      ../Assets/V3 -Optimal Substructure-/find-longest-path-no-revisiting.png
    Find the cheapest possible flights using some sort of web search -real word example-:
      ../Assets/V3 -Optimal Substructure-/find-cheapest-path.png
        Seems like logically that it should exhibit optimal substructure.
          But because of the way that airlines sell their tickets, that was not the case.
V4 -Writing A Recursive Solution-:
  My Try To Implement Fibonacci Sequence Recursively:
    ../Scripts/V4 -Writing A Recursive Solution-/my-try-fibonacci-sequence-recursively.js
  Video demonstrate how our recursive solution work: 
    ../Assets/V4 -Writing A Recursive Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-recursively.mp4
V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-:
  Our current solution is very slow and that because:
    fib(1) directly return 1.
    fib(2) directly return 1.
    fib(3) Requires fib(1) and fib(2) so it's two operations.
    fib(4) Requires fib(2) and fib(3) so it's three operations.
    fib(5) Requires fib(3) and fib(4) so it's five operations.
    fib(6) Requires fib(4) and fib(5) so it's eight operations.
    fib(7) Requires fib(5) and fib(6) so it's thirteen operations.
      The number of the operation is almost being duplicated from a degree to the next degree.
        That means the Big O of the current solution is O(2ⁿ).
    See:
      ../Assets/V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-of-five.png
      ../Assets/V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-of-six.png
      ../Assets/V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-of-seven.png
      ../Assets/V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-from-two-to-seven.png
  The Big O of our solution:
    The approximation is O(2ⁿ), which is also called exponential.
      Even worse than quadratic.
    See:
      ../Assets/V5 -Time Complexity of Our Solution-/fibonacci-sequence-big-o.png
    The exact big O of the Fibonacci sequence, O(1.6ⁿ) 
  How about memorize the result of the previous handled function with their degree, let's try:
    ../Scripts/V5 -...-/my-try-fibonacci-sequence-recursively-with-memorizing.js
V6 -The Problem With Our Solution-:
  The problem:
    Repeating the same operations over and over. 
    For example in Fib(5):
      We calculate the fib(3) twice.
      Ignoring the duplicate also in fib(2) and fib(1) since they directly return 1.
    The more input value increases the more repetitive operations increase.
    See:
      ../Assets/V6 -...-/fibonacci-sequence-of-five-repetition-problem.png
      ../Assets/V6 -...-/fibonacci-sequence-of-six-repetition-problem.png
      ../Assets/V6 -...-/fibonacci-sequence-of-seven-repetition-problem.png
    Solution:
      Just remember the result of the previous operations so we can avoid the repetition.
        Return the already stored result directly.
          And that's what dynamic programming about:
            Using past knowledge to make solving a future problem easier.
            Method for solving a complex problem, by: 
              Breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems. 
              Solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
V7 -Enter Memoization!-:
  My Solution:
    It the same thing we thought about in:
      ../Scripts/V5 -...-/my-try-fibonacci-sequence-recursively-with-memorizing.js
  Construction Solution:
    ../Scripts/V7 -Enter Memoization!-/constructor-solution.js
  Memoization:
    The idea of this strategy is having some structure to store data. 
      In an array or an object usually.
    So whenever do an expensive operation we store it result.
      We never want that result we call it from our data structure. 
        Avoiding executing the operation again.
  Video demonstrate the usage of memorization technique with the Fibonacci Sequence:
    ../Assets/V7 -Enter Memoization-/fibonacci-sequence-recursively-with-memoization.mp4
V8 -Time Complexity of Memoized Solution-:
  Big O of our memorized solution:
    Roughly as -n- grows, the time that it takes for our algorithm grows in proportion.
      So it's O(n) -just generalization-.
V9 -Tabulation: A Bottom Up Approach-:
  My Early Try To Implement Fibonacci SequenceWith Tabulation:
    ../Scripts/V9 -Tabulation A Bottom Up Approach-/my-try-fibonacci-sequence-with-tabulation.js
  Constructor Solution:
    ../Scripts/V9 -Tabulation A Bottom Up Approach-/constructor-solution.js
  Bottom-Up -Tabulation-:
    Another flavor of Dynamic Programming is Bottom-Up:
    Working in a different direction.
      Start from the simplest and the smallest subproblem.
    Storing the result of a previous result in a "table" -usually an array-.
    Usually done using iteration.
    Better space complexity can be achieved using tabulation.

V1 -Which Data Structure Is The Best?-:
  What is Data Structures:
    Collections of values, along with:
      The relationships among them. 
      The functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
    There's dozens of very well-known. 
    There's hundreds or maybe thousands of very niche data structures.
    For Example an array.
      Array holds many values.
      Array contains the relationships between those values -the order-.
      Arrays come with all sorts of built in methods and functionality.
        Ways of interacting with them: 
          Add, remove, push, pop, also sort, reverse, etc.
  What are Arrays and Objects:
    Data Structure that came for free in JS, since they are beneficial in a lot of cases.
  Future Implementation On Advanced Data Structure:
    Create Theme from Scratch.
    Define the relationship between the value of that data structure.
    Create the functions those help us to interact with the data structure values easily, like:
      Pop, Push, and so on... correspondent to the type of data structure we deal with.
  Why we have so many data structure:
    Different data structures excel at different things. 
    Some are highly specialized, while others arrays for example are more generally used.
  Visual Representations Of Various Data Structures:
    Array:
      ../Assets/array.png
    Linked List -Singly linked list-:
      ../Assets/singly-linked-list.png
    Hash table:
      ../Assets/hash-tables.png
    Binary heap:
      ../Assets/binary-heap.png
        Type of tree, specifically a binary tree.
    Binary search tree:
      ../Assets/binary-search-tree.png
    Graph -Unweighted, undirected graph-:
      ../Assets/unweighted-undirected-graph.png
    Graph -Unweighted, directed graph-:
      ../Assets/unweighted-directed-graph.png
      All of these do the same thing, they store data. but:
        The behavior, the relationships between the data and their functionality are different. 
          The methods we get to act upon them are very different.
  Why we should care:
    With time you'll need to use one of these data structures.
    You've already worked with many of them unknowingly, like:
      The DOM in JavaScript, is a tree.
        If you know them, you will have the power to deal with them with more efficient way. 
    They came in interviews.
  The best Data Structure Ever:
    There isn't.
    All excel in different environments.
  Situation And The Best Data Structure Of It:
    Map Or Location: Graph.
    Ordered List With Faster Insertion and Removing form both sided: Linked List.
    Web Scraping Nested HTML: Tree.
    Need to write a Scheduled: Binary Heap.
V2 -ES2015 Class Syntax Overview-:
  Data Structure Types:
    Classic data structures:
      Singly linked lists, doubly linked list, stacks, queues...
    Complicated data structures:
      Trees, binary search trees, graphs...
  ES2015 And Data Structure Creation:
    In order to create these data structures, we need to use of the ES2015 class syntax in JS.
      It makes it really easy and simple for us to define our data structures.
    JS doesn't really support OOP -object oriented programming-.
      But with the year 2015, a new class keyword was introduced.
  Section Objectives:
    Explain what a class is.
    Understand how JavaScript implements the idea of classes.
    Define terms like abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism.
    Use ES2015 classes to implement data structures.
  Class definition:
    A blueprint for creating objects with pre-defined properties and methods.
    In JS: 
      Primarily syntactical sugar over JS existing prototype-based inheritance.
      The class syntax does not introduce a new object oriented inheritance model to JS.
      JS has never really been truly object oriented.
        It takes advantage of prototype-based inheritance.
V3 -Data Structures: The Class Keyword-:
  How We Declare A Class And Additional Tries:
    ../Scripts/V3 -Data Structures The Class Keyword-/play-around-with-js-class.js
  More Info About Class:
    Conventionally, classes should start with a capital letter.
    The class keyword creates a constant, so you can not redefine it.
  This keyword:
    In JS its meaning changes depending on its context.
    When we're inside of a constructor, it refers to the individual instance of the class.
V4 -Data Structures: Adding Instance Methods-:
  Instance Methods:
    Function which is part of a class, and acts on an instance of that class.
  Example Of Instance Methods And More:
    ../Scripts/V4 -Data Structures Adding Instance Methods-/play-around-with-instance-method.js
V5 -Data Structures: Adding Class Methods-:
  Class Method:
    They are called Static methods.
    Methods within a class that have no access to anything else in the class, they don't need to.
    Generally they are used for some purposes that not linked to only one instance. 
    See:
      ../Scripts/V5 -Data Structures Adding Class Methods-/static-methods.js
  We learned about the JS classes to use in the future fir our data structure.
    An example of how we will do this:
      ../Scripts/V5 -Data Structures Adding Class Methods-/classes-and-data-structure-example.js
        We will be using the constructor and instance methods quite a bit!
        We will almost never be using static methods.
  THIS Keyword:
    Inside all of our instance methods and constructor. 
      The keyword -this- refers to the object created from that class -the instance-.
  Recap
    Classes are blueprints that when created make objects known as instances.
    Classes are created with the -new- keyword.
    The constructor function is a special function that gets run when the class is instantiated.
    Instance methods can be added to classes similar to methods in objects.
    Class methods can be added using the static keyword.
===================================================================================================
Arrays and Object In JS and other Languages:
  In JS arrays are: 
    Teated as objects under the hood, object with integer keys. 
    Specialized objects where the keys are integers.
      This means you can access array elements using integer indices, but you can also: 
        Attach non-numeric properties to arrays, just like objects, See:
          ../Scripts/Additional Info/JS Arrays Vs Others/array-with-properties.js
  This is a key distinction between JS arrays and arrays in languages like C++ or Java. 
    Where arrays are typically more memory-efficient. 
  Memory and Performance: 
    Due to their dynamic nature. 
      JS arrays might not be as memory-efficient as arrays in languages like C++ or Java.
  In Other Languages Like C++
    Arrays are much more rigid, we have:
      Fixed Size: 
        Arrays have a fixed size. 
        You cannot dynamically add or remove elements without creating a new array.
      Memory Efficiency: 
        Arrays in C++ are more memory-efficient. 
        They are contiguous blocks of memory. 
          Each element is stored directly next to the previous one.
            Allowing faster access and manipulation.
      No Custom Properties: 
        Unlike in JS, you cannot attach arbitrary properties to arrays. 
        They are purely for storing a sequence of elements.
    See:
      ../Scripts/Additional Info/JS Arrays Vs Others/array-in-cpp.cpp
  JS Array And Their Dynamic Nature:
    Arrays do not guarantee that elements are stored in contiguous blocks of memory. 
      Unlike in languages like C++.
    Memory Layout in JavaScript Arrays:
      Dynamic Nature: 
        JavaScript arrays are dynamic and can change in size during runtime. 
        Because of this flexibility, the underlying memory layout is more complex.
      Sparse Arrays: 
        JavaScript arrays can be sparse. 
          Meaning that not all indices need to have a value. 
          For example: 
            You can create an array with a length of 100 but only assign a value to the index `50`. 
            This would be inefficient to store in contiguous memory, and because of this: 
              JS engine often optimize this by storing such arrays in a way that resembles objects. 
                With only the occupied indices being stored.
      Engine Optimization: 
        Modern JavaScript engines like -V8 in Chrome- optimize the storage of arrays. 
        When an array behaves in a predictable, dense, and contiguous manner. 
          Like a typical array in other languages-. 
        the engine might store it in a contiguous block of memory for performance reasons. 
        If the array starts to behave more like an object 
          Adding non-numeric properties, or making it sparse. 
        the engine might switch to a different, less efficient storage strategy.
      See: 
        ../Scripts/Additional Info/JS Arrays And Memory/js-array-and-storage.js
    Summary:
      JS arrays are not guaranteed to be stored in contiguous memory blocks. 
        Their storage can vary based on how they are used. 
        If the array behaves in a predictable and dense manner.
          The JS engine might optimize it to be more efficient in memory.
            But this is not something you can directly control or rely on.
      Languages like C++ always store arrays in contiguous memory. 
        Which is why they are more memory-efficient for this specific use case.

JS and Class Keyword:
  See:
    ../Scripts/Additional Info/Js And The Keyword Class/js-class-keyword-behind-the-scenes.js
===================================================================================================
JS and OOP:
  JS Classes are indeed built on top of functions, but: 
    This does not mean that JavaScript doesn’t support Object-Oriented Programming -OOP-.
    JS fully supports OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
      Though it does so in a way that is distinct from class-based languages like Java or C++.
  JavaScript Classes as Functions:
    In earlier versions of JavaScript -before ES6-. 
    Objects and inheritance were handled using constructor functions and prototypes. 
    ES6 introduced the class syntax.
      Syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance.
    See:
      ../Scripts/Additional Info/JS OOP Versions Comparison/js-before-and-after-class-keyword.js
  Understanding JavaScript’s OOP Support:
    Encapsulation: 
      JS supports encapsulation through closures and the use of classes -or constructor functions-. 
      You can create private variables using closures or symbols to limit access.
        They are powerful tools in JS for achieving: 
          Encapsulation and controlling access to an object's internal state.
        More about Closures and Symbols in the bottom.
    Inheritance: 
      JS implements inheritance via prototypes. 
      The class syntax in ES6 makes it easier to work with inheritance.
      You can extend classes using the extends keyword.
    Polymorphism: 
      JS supports polymorphism through method overriding.
      See:
        ../Scripts/Additional Info/JS And Polymorphism
          The -speak- method in the Dog -class- overrides the -speak- method in the -Animal- class.
  JS and prototype:
    Even with the class syntax, JS is still fundamentally prototype-based. 
    Every function in JavaScript has a prototype property.
      Used to build up the inheritance chain.
    When you create an instance of a class -or constructor function-. 
      The instance inherits properties and methods from the constructor's prototype.
    See:
      ""../Scripts/Additional Info/JS And Prototype/js-prototype.js
  Closures:
    Function that remembers the environment in which it was created. 
    Function can access variables from an outer fun even after that outer fun has returned. 
    Closures are often used to create private variables and methods.
    Allow you to create private variables and methods by enclosing them in a function's scope. 
    This is particularly useful for encapsulation.
    It ensures that certain data is not accessible outside the function.
    See:
      ""../Scripts/Additional Info/JS Closure
  Symbols:
    Unique and immutable primitive value introduced in ES6. 
    They can be used to create private-like properties on objects. 
      As each symbol is guaranteed to be unique, even if they have the same description.
    Way to create unique, private-like properties on objects. 
    They offer another method of encapsulation. 
    Creating unique keys for object properties, which aren't easily accessible or enumerable.
    See:
      ../Scripts/Additional Info/Symbol/symbol-and-private-properties.js
